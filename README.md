# palworld-helmchart
My private try of creating a helmchart for a palworld server

## Notice
I am working on the Dockerfile as of now, takes longer than expected. 
Reason for that is I am trying to get the Dockerimage arm64 ready, which means I have to use solutions like QEMU, Box86 or Fex to run steamcmd on arm.
